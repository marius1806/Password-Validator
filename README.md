# Password Validator

# Stancu Gabriel-Marius

This is a simple console application written in C++ 
meant to validate your password. This means that the 
app will tell if the password you created is weak, 
average, good or strong by analysing the characters
used. The app will also tell you if your password a
valid one. If it isn't you will need to try again.

To run this program write in the command prompt:
g++ password.hpp password.cpp main.cpp
